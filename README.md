# BDD-Exercise-Shopping-Website


This repo contains automated frontend testing exercises using Selinium and Cucumber. 

The task is to use a shopping website, browse for a particular product, adding it to cart and then checking out. 

Selinium in conjunction with Cucumber is a great way to automate front end testing. The Pseudo code approach of Cucumber using the "Given, When, Then" approach helps to organise and understand the code better. This allows for the incorporation of Behaviour Driven Develeopment.
